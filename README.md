What your project is/does (and what it's called):
My project compares the the increase in access of electricity and it's effect on women's education and quality of life in India. It's called "Bright Futures" to reflect that.

Why you made your project:
I made it primarily for the Girls Who Code (GWC) Pathways program, but I chose this topic as I was interested in how electricity could impact women's quality of life, as well as education.

How you made your project:
I made it through using the large database that GWC provided, choosing electricity and quality of life as I am very interested and passionate about this.

What you struggled with and what you learned:
I struggled with getting the VNC to display my scatterplot properly, as I hadn't made a scatterplot or any type of plot in python before. I'm kind of proud of it :)

Note: This project did indeed take me 2 hours, since I had to make multiple projects to practice and learn all this python :)

Thanks for running my project!! <3
